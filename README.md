# Machinedrum Pitch Map

Under the hood of the Elektron Machinedrum is synth capable of generating pitched sounds beyond its primary drum voices. This project aims to be an interactive tool for creating pitched sequences without relying on a chart or going by ear.


### Credits:
The pitch values used in this tool are taken from [GWEEP's original frequency analysis](http://gweep.net/~shifty/machinedrum/), which was later refined in [elektronauts forum](http://www.elektronauts.com/topics/view/8643/69758/page:1#69758) user OH/EX/OH's MD Pitch Chart. Many thanks to them for their work.
